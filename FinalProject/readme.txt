\
The goal is to classify credit card applicants as trustworthy or not trustworthy.\
Individuals are trustworthy if they have met deadlines every month that they have owned the credit card.\
\
The models evaluated on the data are Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoostClassifier, KNN and Tensorflow Sequential.\
\
I was able to significantly decide that the Random Forest was able to classify the model.\
The model is not very accurate and requires further data/modeling.}
